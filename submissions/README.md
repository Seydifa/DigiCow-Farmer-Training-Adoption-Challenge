# Submissions Folder

This folder contains all competition submission files generated by the training pipeline.

## Submission Format

Each submission file follows the competition's required format:

```csv
ID,Target_AUC,Target_LogLoss
ID_KYOSSX,0.123456,0.123456
ID_ADB87D,0.789012,0.789012
ID_XYZ13I,0.345678,0.345678
```

### Columns:

- **ID**: Test sample identifier
- **Target_AUC**: Probability predictions for ROC-AUC metric (30% weight in final score)
- **Target_LogLoss**: Probability predictions for Log Loss metric (70% weight in final score)

Both columns contain the same probability values (0-1 range), representing the likelihood that a farmer will adopt a DigiCow-supported practice within the target time window.

## Scoring Metrics

The final leaderboard score is a weighted average of two metrics:

1. **Log Loss (70%)**: Penalizes confident but incorrect predictions more heavily, encouraging reliable probability estimates
2. **ROC-AUC (30%)**: Measures the model's ability to rank adopters above non-adopters across all thresholds

## Submission Files

Each pipeline run creates 4 submission files:

1. **submission_voting_soft.csv** - Soft voting ensemble (weighted average of probability predictions)
2. **submission_stacking_lr.csv** - Stacking ensemble with Logistic Regression meta-learner
3. **submission_weighted_average.csv** - Weighted average based on cross-validation scores
4. **submission_meta_ensemble.csv** - ⭐ **RECOMMENDED** - Meta-ensemble (average of all methods)

```

## Usage

After running the training pipeline:

```bash
python train_pipeline.py --preset fast
```

Submission files will be automatically saved to `submissions/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`

The recommended file for submission is `submission_meta_ensemble.csv`, which combines all ensemble methods for the most robust predictions.
